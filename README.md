**Conclusions:**

The rise of IoT technologies and data-driven finance seriously influences the daily life and behavior of customers. Digital payments are spreading rapidly and gaining in importance, mainly since the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of recent advances, namely AI, big data, and cloud computing are attracting huge interest from researchers. Although an abundance of research has been undertaken in the field in recent years, but the best model proposed is still not agreed.

After comparing between the models, the results were found as follows:
+ The topic uses Machine Learning models to come up with the best model to Credit Card Fraud Detection.
+ The best model given is **Logistic Regression Model**.
+ Accuracy of best model is **97.29%**.
+ ROC of best model is **97.69%**.
